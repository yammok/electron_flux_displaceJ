# Maxwell's displacement current density (for H2 molecule)

This code is the one to calculate and visualize the current density for one-body electronic density from the data obtained by electronic structure calculation. The electronic current density is expressed by Maxwell's displacement current density, namely, 
$$ \begin{eqnarray} 4a &=& ((a+a)+a)+a \ &=& (a+a)+(a+a) \end{eqnarray} $$
